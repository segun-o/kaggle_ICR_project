# kaggle_ICR_project
The goal of this competition is to predict if a person has any of three medical conditions. 
To determine if someone has these medical conditions requires a long and intrusive process to collect information from patients. With predictive models, 
we can shorten this process and keep patient details private by collecting key characteristics relative to the conditions, then encoding these characteristics.
